            paragraph1:"I started to work in Cafe de las Ciudades, a book publisher specialized in Urbanism, in 2019. I was in charge of comercialization, a role which included dealing with clients, suppliers and book shops. I suggested to open an ecommerce site, which I created with a CMS (TiendaNube). I also ran a strong ad-campaign in social media. They were thrilled to see the result (and their facturation growing up to 7 times!), so then I was in charge of re-designing the website for their monthly newsletter, in its 20th anniversary. I managed to do that with another CMS (Wordpress). I got more and more deeply involved in programing websites and suddenly I realized I that had encountered my new passion. I´ve got really focused on learning everything about web developing while working in a lot of different projects for people around (and later for unkowned clients in Feverr). The word kept running mouth to mouth and I ended building and designing a lot of projects to reach different expectations. Now I have a strong desire to be involved in a group of people to participate in building bigger things, keep the level of complexity going up to continue learning and growing as developer. ",
            paragraph2:"I think I can add a really good base on soft skills, I´m used to work with people from different cultures and can comunicate clearly in English, Spanish and Portuguese. I´ve work in the music industry previously, in the production field, so I´m used to deal with deadlines, group leadership and tricky commercial affaires. "
